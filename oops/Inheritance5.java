In general, the meaning of hybrid (mixture) is made of more than one thing.
In Java, the hybrid inheritance is the composition of two or more types of inheritance.
The main purpose of using hybrid inheritance is to modularize the code into well-defined classes. 
It also provides the code reusability. The hybrid inheritance can be achieved by using the following combinations:

Single and Multiple Inheritance (not supported but can be achieved through interface)
Multilevel and Hierarchical Inheritance
Hierarchical and Single Inheritance
Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance
